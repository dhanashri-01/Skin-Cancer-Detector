## Lesion Types

The model identifies the following skin lesion categories:

1. **nv**: Melanocytic nevi (benign melanocyte neoplasms).
2. **mel**: Melanoma (malignant melanocyte neoplasms).
3. **bkl**: Benign keratosis lesions.
4. **bcc**: Basal cell carcinoma.
5. **akiec**: Actinic keratoses/intraepithelial carcinoma.
6. **vasc**: Vascular lesions.
7. **df**: Dermatofibroma (benign cutaneous lesion).

Descriptions are derived from dermatological research.
